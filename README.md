# Exeterproject
TranslateWordsChallenge
Programming Language: Python3

1. Project completed successfully. All casing problems were handled.
2. Each word is replaced only once.
3. Time Complexity: Since CSV contains 1000 words, it will take more time to iterate that file. So csv is converted to python dictionary to reduce the time taken
4. Space Complexity: Very low memory consumed(only one python dictionary)
